# 📌 INTRODUCTION  
This project clusters mall customers based on their spending behavior using unsupervised learning.  
The goal is to identify customer segments that can help tailor marketing strategies effectively.

The dataset contains information like age, annual income, and spending score, which will be used to group similar customers.

# 🎯 Objectives:  
- Load and preprocess the dataset  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Apply K-Means Clustering  
- Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize clusters  
- Suggest marketing strategies for each cluster  

# ✅ FINAL CONCLUSION

Cluster Results (K-means on Age, Annual Income, Spending Score):  
- Cluster 0 – Luxury Shoppers: Young to middle-aged, high income, high spending score.  
- Cluster 1 – Budget-Conscious Seniors: Older, low income, low spending score.  
- Cluster 2 – Value Hunters: Young, low-to-mid income, high spending score.  
- Cluster 3 – Mid-Income Steady Buyers: Middle-aged, medium income, medium spending score.  
- Cluster 4 – High-Income Low Spenders: High income, low spending score.  

Insights from Cluster Analysis:  
K-means segmentation revealed that the most influential factors were:  
- Annual income — clear separation between high and low earners.  
- Spending score — key to differentiating spending behavior.  
- Age — indicated different spending trends by life stage.  

# 🔍 Strategic Suggestions:

1. Tailor marketing efforts by cluster profile to maximize engagement and ROI.

2. Offer exclusive perks and early product launches to Luxury Shoppers.

3. Provide affordable essentials and avoid aggressive upselling for Budget-Conscious Seniors.

4. Use flash sales, discounts, and bundles to attract Value Hunters.

5. Encourage repeat purchases in Mid-Income Steady Buyers with loyalty programs.

6. Create aspirational campaigns and premium upsells targeting High-Income Low Spenders.

Summary:  
K-means clustering enables precise customer segmentation. Aligning campaigns with customer groups’ unique behaviors can improve revenue, enhance customer experience, and reduce wasted marketing spend.
